# PaperAI

PaperAI is a multi-agent deep research and RAG system that enables intelligent document querying and autonomous research execution. Users can upload multiple files and query them as a knowledge base using hybrid search, while the Deep Research mode deploys planner-executor agents to autonomously plan, decompose, and execute complex research tasks — purpose-built for financial analysis workflows.
